# Fileorganizer

## Features

### Filelengthfinder
This is a little feature to search files with a filename which has a minimum length.
You can decide if you want to include foldernames or not and if you want to use the full path as name.

### Tagger
With this feature you can edit your tags, create your tags from filename or create your filename from tags.
For now only MP3-artist and -title and only one filename-pattern are supported.

## Usage
With
```bash
java -jar Fileorganizer.jar
```
it asks you with which arguments to run.

With
```bash
java -jar Fileorganizer.jar OPTIONS
```
you can directly set the arguments.
~~To see all available options use:~~
```bash
~~java -jar Fileorganizer.jar --help~~
```
(not yet supported)
